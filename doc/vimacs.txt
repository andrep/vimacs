*Vimacs.01*  Introduction

						*vimacs*

						*vimacs-introduction*

Vimacs (Vim-Improved eMACS) brings Emacs' extensive key bindings and modeless
editing features to the Vim world, while completely retaining Vim's
powerful moded editing style.

Vimacs is based on the keymaps of GNU Emacs 21 and XEmacs, so if you are
familiar with them, you'll feel right at home in Vimacs.  For Emacs users,
most (if not all) of the common key maps in Emacs are present in Vimacs, such
as <C-Space>, <C-w> and <C-y> to mark, kill and yank regions, <C-x><C-f> to
find a file, and <C-x>2 to vertically split a window.  However, you can now
take advantage of the incredible power of Vim's Normal and Command modes with
a touch of the <Esc> key.

Why use Vimacs instead of Emacs?  Vim's configuration and option tweaking is
arguably much easier than doing the same task in the Emacs world; its
scripting language is simpler and more conventional than LISP, and still very
powerful.  Python, Perl, and |libcall()| (C library interface) support allow
for incredibly powerful scripting if you need something which is the equal of
ELISP.  Vim is heavily optimised for speed and text editing; you may find Vim
to be much quicker in many tasks.  While Emacs and Vim may run on equally as
many platforms, Vim often has superior support for non-Unix operating systems
in comparison to Emacs; e.g. Vim for Win32 can natively function as a DDE
server and can integrate into Microsoft Visual Studio.

If you're a long-time Vim user, you retain vi's powerful moded editing
paradigm while gaining all the benefits of Emacs' modeless editing.  After a
while, the <C-a> and <C-e> keys will become second nature to you, just as
you're used to the |h|, |j|, |k|, and |l| keys for movement.  Some of the keys
familiar to you in Insert mode have been changed, but you won't take long to
get used to Emacs' keys: just like Vim, Emacs' key layout has been designed so
that commonly used keys are quick to access.  Emacs' initially strange key
layout will reward you later on for its efficiency, just like Vim does.  Emacs
experts are just as fast as Vim experts in manipulating text, and as a bonus,
you start becoming familiar with Emacs keybindings, which are gradually
becoming more pervasive in Unix applications.  (Even MacOS X supports some
Emacs keys in its dialog boxes!)

						*vimacs-terminology*
						
Vim and Emacs use different (and sometimes conflicting) terminology.  Since
Vimacs runs within the Vim environment, we will use the Vim terminology rather
than Emacs terminology.

	Emacs Terminology	Vim Terminology

	(key)binding		map
	point			cursor
	kill			yank
	yank			paste
	register		mark
	rectangle		block
	kill-ring		registers

It is Vim standard that key bindings are written in |<>| notation; thankfully
this is essentially the same as Emacs' key binding notation.  In Emacs, the
key combination Control-x followed by Control-f is written as "C-x C-f"; in
Vim, this is written as "<C-x><C-f>".  Meta-f in Emacs is written as "M-f"; in
Vim, this is written as "<M-f>" or "<A-f>".  (The 'A' stands for Alt; in Vim,
there is no distinction between the Meta and Alt keys.)  Vim helpfiles also
use a |CTRL-X_CTRL-F|-style notation; Vimacs-specific keys will use a
|vimacs:CTRL-X_CTRL-F| notation.

For the gory details of Vim notation, see |notation|.

						*vimacs-help-navigation*

Emacs users: If you are not in insert mode (if you do not see a line at the
bottom of the screen saying "-- INSERT MODE --"), use <C-]> to follow a link,
and <C-t> to go back a link.  If you are using Vimacs keybindings and are in
Insert mode, you can follow a help link such as |vimacs-introduction| by
moving your cursor over it and pressing <M-.>.  This is the same as Emacs'
typical <M-.> keybinding, which is the |vimacs:find-tags| command.  Jump back
to your previous position using the <M-*> key.

Vim users: Pressing <M-.> in Insert mode performs the same function as
|CTRL-]| in Normal mode.  <M-*> is equivalent to |CTRL-T|.


==============================================================================
*Vimacs.02*  Installing Vimacs

						*vimacs-quickstart*

The following quick start guides are for Win32 and Unix systems.  Detailed
installation instructions follow afterward.

						*vimacs-win32-quickstart*

Firstly, you'll need Vim 6 installed.  Vimacs won't work on older
versions.

To install Vimacs, copy the .txt file in the archive to your Vim
documentation directory (typically "C:\Program Files\vim\vimfiles\doc"),
and copy the .vim file to your plugin directory (typically "C:\Program
Files\vim\vimfiles\plugin").

See the |vimacs-installation| topic in the main Vimacs help file for full
information.

						*vimacs-unix-quickstart*

Firstly, you'll need Vim 6 installed.  Vimacs won't work on older
versions.  So, make sure you're running Vim 6:
>
	vim --version | head -1
<
The reply you get should say "VIM - Vi IMproved 6.0" (or higher).

To install Vimacs, execute the following commands in your shell:
>
	mkdir -p $HOME/.vim/doc
	mkdir -p $HOME/.vim/plugin
	cp -R doc plugin $HOME/.vim
<
Run the following command in a shell to make Vim rescan your documentation
directory:
>
	vim --cmd "helptags $HOME/.vim/doc" --cmd "q"
<
That's it.  If you're a Vim user, Emacs key mappings will now be enabled
whenever you're in Vim's Insert mode.  If you're an Emacs user and have
never used Vim before, you probably want to always keep Vim in Insert
Mode, and use Select mode rather than Visual mode:
>
	echo 'set insertmode' >> $HOME/.vimrc
	echo 'set selectmode += cmd' >> $HOME/.vimrc
<
Vimacs is now completely installed.  However ...

If you want to have a more sophisticated setup, where you can type a
different command (such as 'vimacs') to always start in Insert mode, but
typing 'vim' starts Vim in Normal mode, read on.

Put the shell script located at plugin/vimacs/vim somewhere in your $PATH,
and symlink it to the appropriate files.  Change the $myscriptdir variable
below to whatever directory you use for scripts; if you don't currently
have one, you'll need to mkdir the directory and add it to your $PATH.
(Consult your local Unix expert on adding directories to your $PATH if you
don't know how to do this.)
>
	myscriptdir=$HOME/bin
	mkdir -p $myscriptdir
	cp plugin/vimacs/vim $myscriptdir
	chmod 755 $myscriptdir/vim
	ln -s $myscriptdir/vim $myscriptdir/gvim
	ln -s $myscriptdir/vim $myscriptdir/vm
	ln -s $myscriptdir/vim $myscriptdir/gvm
	ln -s $myscriptdir/vim $myscriptdir/vimacs
	ln -s $myscriptdir/vim $myscriptdir/gvimacs
	myscriptdir=
<
For more detailed installation instructions, see |vimacs-installation| in
the Vimacs help file.

						*vimacs-installation*

Vimacs is designed for Vim 6 only; if you are running Vim 5.x, please upgrade
to Vim 6.  There is no intention to `port' Vimacs to run on older versions of
Vim.

Vimacs is a Vim 6 plugin; simply drop it into any Vim plugin directory, such
as "$HOME/.vim/plugin" on a Unix system, or "C:\Program
Files\vim\vimfiles\plugin" on Windows.  You may also want to place this
documentation (the "vimacs.txt" file) in a Vim documentation directory; e.g.
"$HOME/.vim/doc", or "C:\Program Files\vim\vimfiles\doc".  You should run the
|:helptags| command on the documentation directory after installation; see
|add-local-help| for more information.

Vimacs does not initially start in Insert mode, to be consistent with what Vim
users normally expect.  If you an Emacs user, you may wish to put
>
	set insertmode
	set selectmode += cmd
<
in your |.vimrc| startup file, so that you use a more Emacs-like selection
mode, as well as being in Insert mode straight away.

Please read the |vimacs-unix| section if you are running Vimacs on a Unix
systems, and |vimacs-non-unix| if you are installing Vimacs on other operating
systems (e.g. Windows, Macintosh).

						*vimacs-unix*
						*vimacs-unix-flow-control*

Like Emacs, Vimacs uses the <C-s> key to search, and <C-q> to insert the next
character literally ('quoted-insert' in Emacs-speak; normally <C-v> in Vim).

In many Unix terminals, <C-s> and <C-q> are flow control characters used to
stop and start terminal output, which means that Vim will look like it has
frozen when you press <C-s>.  (This problem only affects the Unix console
version of Vim; gvim is not affected.)  Emacs modifies your terminal's
settings, so it doesn't normally have this problem.  Vim, however, does not
modify terminal settings, and thus you need to explicitly turn off flow
control.

To solve the <C-s>/<C-q> flow control problem, you need to turn off XON/XOFF
flow control processing for your tty.  The stty(1) command will do this: 
>
	$ stty -ixon -ixoff
<
You may wish to make a shell script somewhere in your path to do this
automatically, e.g.
>
	$ cat << END > $HOME/bin/vim
	#!/bin/sh

	# turn off flow control if we're a terminal
	[ -t 0 ] && stty -ixon -ixoff

	exec /usr/bin/vim "$@"
	END
<
For a more in-depth example of using a wrapper shell script to initialise Vim
(and Vimacs) to your choosing, see |vimacs-unix-progname|

						*vimacs-unix-meta-sends-esc*

This applies to the console version of Vim only (i.e. not gvim).  On many Unix
terminals, the Meta key typically generates an <Esc> followed by the
combination key; for example, pressing <M-x> generates the key sequences
<Esc>x.  However, you may have a terminal emulator that sends <M-x> as an 'x'
with the 8th bit set, rather than as <Esc>x.  Most Unix terminal emulators,
(including xterm) have an option to do this, but do not enable it by default.
If your terminal sends <M-x> as x with the 8th bit set, set the
|'g:VM_UnixConsoleRemapEsc'| option to 1.

NOTE: This is not a Vimacs-specific problem; Vim also has to work around this
issue, with options like 'esckeys', 'timeout' and 'ttimeout'.

						*vimacs-unix-progname*

Via the magic of shell scripts (and symlinks), it's possible to change the
default behaviour of Vimacs, depending on what you typed to run it.  For
example:

	Command name	Load Vimacs?	Start in/use Insert mode?

	(g)vim		yes		no/no
	(g)vimacs	yes		yes/yes
	(g)vm[1]	yes		yes/yes

	1. `vm' is an abbreviation for `ViMacs'

To do the above, firstly, make a directory to store programs and scripts in,
and add that directory to your $PATH:
>
	$ mkdir $HOME/bin 
	$ export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
<
Save the following shell script in the above directory as "vim".  For
convenience, this script is also available in the plugin/vimacs directory;
simply copy it to $HOME/bin/vim.
>
	#!/bin/sh
	
	# real path to vim
	VIM_CMD=${VIM_CMD:-/usr/bin/vim}
	GVIM_CMD=${GVIM_CMD:-/usr/bin/gvim}
	
	# what program name was i run as?
	argv0=`basename $0`
	
	# turn off software flow control so <C-s> and <C-q> will work. you can add
	# extra stty settings by setting $VIM_STTY (i use 'erase ^?' here)
	[ -t 0 ] && stty -ixon -ixoff $VIM_STTY
	
	case "$argv0" in
	  g*)
	    VIM_CMD="$GVIM_CMD"
	    ;;
	esac
	
	case "$argv0" in
	  *diff)
	    VIM_CMD="${VIM_CMD}diff"
	    ;;
	esac
	
	case "$argv0" in
	  # This case has to come before vim
	  *vm*|*vimacs*)
	    exec $VIM_CMD --cmd "let g:VM_Enabled = 1" \
			  --cmd "set insertmode" \
			        "$@"
	    ;;
	  *vim*)
	    exec $VIM_CMD --cmd "let g:VM_Enabled = 1" \
	                        "$@"
	    ;;
	esac
	
<
Now, make your vim command executable:
>
	chmod a+x $HOME/bin/vim
<
Finally, make symlinks from the `vim' shell script to the other commands
you'll be running it as:
>
	ln -s $HOME/bin/vim $HOME/bin/gvim
	ln -s $HOME/bin/vim $HOME/bin/vm
	ln -s $HOME/bin/vim $HOME/bin/gvm
	ln -s $HOME/bin/vim $HOME/bin/vimacs
	ln -s $HOME/bin/vim $HOME/bin/gvimacs
	ln -s $HOME/bin/vim $HOME/bin/vimdiff
	ln -s $HOME/bin/vim $HOME/bin/gvimdiff
	ln -s $HOME/bin/vim $HOME/bin/vmdiff
	ln -s $HOME/bin/vim $HOME/bin/gvmdiff
	ln -s $HOME/bin/vim $HOME/bin/vimacsdiff
	ln -s $HOME/bin/vim $HOME/bin/gvimacsdiff
<
Now, after all that hard work, you can give Vim different personalities
just by running a different command name!

						*vimacs-non-unix*

There are no special notes for running Vimacs on non-Unix operating systems.


==============================================================================
*Vimacs.03*  Vimacs Options

						*vimacs-options*
						
Vimacs can change its behaviour to your liking by setting variables in your
Vim startup file ("$HOME/.vimrc" in Unix; "C:\Program Files\vim\_vimrc" in
Windows; see |.vimrc| for more information).  You can set variables using
|:let| command, e.g.

>
	let g:VM_CmdHeightAdj = 0
	let g:VM_NormalMetaXRemap = 1
<

						*vimacs-option-list*

						*'g:VM_CmdHeightAdj'*

'g:VM_CmdHeightAdj'		number	(default 1)

	Adjust the current 'cmdheight' setting.  Vimacs will normally increase
	the 'cmdheight' option to 2 if it's less than 2 and the 'showmode'
	option is set, because the mode message will often obscure the most
	recent message.

						*'g:VM_Dev'*

'g:VM_Dev'			number	(default 0)

	Turn on "developer mode"; forces overwriting of commands, functions
	and maps which already exist when Vimacs is loaded.  Vimacs will not
	typically load its own commands, functions or mappings if one
	currently exist.

						*'g:VM_Enabled'*

'g:VM_Enabled'			number	(default 1)

	Don't load Vimacs at all.  May be useful in your startup script, e.g.
	for Unix people who use the "less" Vim script:
>
		if v:progname == "less"
		  source /usr/share/doc/vim/macros/less.vim
		  let g:VM_Enabled = 0
		endif
<
						*'g:VM_F10Menu'*

'g:VM_F10Menu'			number	(default 1)

	Enable the <F10> key to pull down the menus which are normally only
	available in the GUI version of Vim.  (GNU Emacs uses F10 for this
	purpose.)

						*'g:VM_NormalMetaXRemap'*

'g:VM_NormalMetaXRemap'		number	(default 1)

	In Normal mode, map the <M-x> key to go to Command mode (i.e. it has
	the same effect as typing |:|).

	NOTE: <M-x> is always enabled in Insert mode; this option affects
	<M-x> in Normal mode only.

						*'g:VM_SearchRepeatHighlight'*

'g:VM_SearchRepeatHighlight'	number	(default 0)

	Highlight all occurances of your current search on the screen when you
	repeat a search with <C-s> or <C-r>.  This effectively turns on the
	'hls' option while you're searching.

						*'g:VM_SingleEscToNormal'*

'g:VM_SingleEscToNormal'	number	(default 1)

	Only need to press the <Esc> once in Insert mode to return to Normal
	mode.  If this option is off, you need to press <Esc><Esc> to return
	to Normal mode; see |vimacs-unix-esc-key| for rationale.

						*'g:VM_UnixConsoleMetaSendsEsc'*

'g:VM_UnixConsoleMetaSendsEsc'	number	(default 1)

	Remap <Esc>x to become <M-x> (where x is any keypress); this is needed
	for Unix terminals which send a Meta key as an Escape sequence, rather
	than sending the keypress with the 8th bit on.  Most Unix terminals
	seem to do that these days.

						*vimacs-vim-options*

Vimacs's operation is heavily influenced by a few of Vim's options.  You can
set them in the usual manner (with the |:set| command).

						*'vimacs-backspace'*
'backspace' 'bs'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}

	Vimacs will automatically set this option, since pressing <BS> in
	Emacs typically backspaces over anything and everything :).

						*'vimacs-cedit'*
'cedit'			string	(Vi default: "", Vim default: CTRL-F)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the |+vertsplit|
			feature}

	Currently, Vimacs relies on the 'cedit' option to be CTRL-F.  This is
	regarded as a bug, and will hopefully be fixed in the future.

				     		*'vimacs-esckeys'*
'esckeys' 'ek'		boolean	(Vim default: on, Vi default: off)
			global
			{not in Vi}

	Vimacs automatically sets this option.  (Note that strictly speaking,
	this may not be necessary ... please send me a patch if you can't live
	with this behaviour).

				     		*'vimacs-hidden'*
'hidden' 'hid'		boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}

	Vimacs will automatically set this option; Emacs always "hidden
	buffers".

				 		*'vimacs-incsearch'*
'incsearch' 'is'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{not available when compiled without the
			|+extra_search| feature}

	CTRL-S (incremental search forward) and CTRL-R (incremental search
	backward) will override Vim's 'incsearch' option; they will always do
	an incremental search.

						*'vimacs-insertmode'*

'insertmode' 'im'	boolean	(default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}

	Setting the 'insertmode' option makes Insert mode the default mode,
	and effectively makes Vim modeless.  This is important for Vimacs
	since it allows for a much more complete emulation of Emacs.  (See
	Vim's 'insertmode' help entry for more detail.)

	When 'insertmode' is set and Vimacs is active, the CTRL-O and CTRL-L
	keys change to the Emacs behaviour, and <Esc> still escapes back to
	normal mode.
	
	See also: the |'g:VM_SingleEscToNormal'| option and
	|vimacs-unix-esc-key|.

						*'vimacs-keymodel'*
'keymodel' 'km'		string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}

	Vimacs will automatically manipulate this option to ensure that
	marking blocks using <C-Space> (and the <Shift> key, if the "key" word
	is included in 'selectmode') works as intended.

						*'vimacs-selection'*
'selection' 'sel'	string	(default "inclusive")
			global
			{not in Vi}

	Vimacs will change the default value of this option to "exclusive",
	since it's very much more Emacs-like in its behaviour.

						*'vimacs-selectmode'*
'selectmode' 'slm'	string	(default "")
			global
			{not in Vi}

	If the "cmd" word is in the 'selectmode' option, Vimacs will use
	Select mode when marking a block using <C-Space>.

						*'vimacs-timeout'*
'timeout' 'to'		boolean (default on)
			global
						*'vimacs-ttimeout'*
'ttimeout'		boolean (default off)
			global
			{not in Vi}

	Vimacs will automatically set these options for optimal behaviour,
	depending on whether the 'insertmode' and |'g:VM_SingleEscToNormal'|
	options are set, and whether you're running in a UNIX console or not.

	This is done for safety reasons; it's quite easy to screw up Vim if
	use <Meta> key mappings extensively and you're running in a UNIX
	console.

						*'vimacs-whichwrap'*
'whichwrap' 'ww'	string	(Vim default: "b,s", Vi default: "")
			global
			{not in Vi}

	Vimacs will automatically manipulate this option to obtain Emacs-like
	behaviour.  (If you're that pedantic about this option, why on earth
	are you using Vimacs in the first place?  Send me a patch, send me
	a patch ...)

						*'vimacs-wildcharm'*
'wildcharm' 'wcm'	number	(default: none (0))
			global
			{not in Vi}

	Vimacs automatically manipulates this option.  If you don't like that,
	send me a patch!

						*'vimacs-winaltkeys'*
'winaltkeys' 'wak'	string	(default "menu")
			global
			{not in Vi}
			{only used in Win32, Motif, GTK and Photon GUI}

	Vimacs will automatically unset this option, since it interferes with
	remapping the <Alt>/<Meta> keys.

*Vimacs.06*  Key Map

Emacs has many keys, and this section of the documentation is currently
incomplete.  If you want to help complete this section, please send me
patches!

Other than looking at the vimacs.vim script file itself, a suggested way of
learning the Emacs key set is from Emacs itself (and Emacs clones such as jed
and jmacs).  Press <C-h>b in GNU Emacs or XEmacs to get a list of key
bindings.

Files and Buffers
						*vimacs:CTRL-X_CTRL-F*

CTRL-X CTRL-F	Loads a new file into the current window; see |:edit|.

						*vimacs:CTRL-X_CTRL-S*

CTRL-X CTRL-S	Saves the current buffer to disk, but only if's been
		modified.  See |:update|.

						*vimacs:CTRL-X_s*

CTRL-X s	Saves all changes buffers to disk; see |:wa|.

						*vimacs:CTRL-X_i*

CTRL-X i	Inserts a file into the current buffer.  See |:read|.

						*vimacs:CTRL-X_CTRL-W*

CTRL-X CTRL-W	Saves the current buffer to disk as a different filename.
		See |:write_f|.

==============================================================================
*Vimacs.07*  Design Comments

This is a collection of anecdotes, design issues and ramblings that I came
across with when writing Vimacs.  Vi was certainly never designed to be used
in a modeless way, and Vimacs pushes Vim's modeless functionality to its
limits, so I expected to encounter some bugs^H^H^H^Hundocumented features in
writing Vimacs.  Somewhat surprisingly, there seems to be only a few small
problems in Vim which limit Vimacs' Emacs emulation capabilities, and these
tend to be philosophical or conceptual differences between the two editors
rather than being actual bugs.  (Quite amazing, considering that the two
editors, at first glance, seem so completely different.)

						*vim-emacs-similarity*

Many Emacs features actually have a direct 1:1 mapping to Vim commands; for
example, Emacs' |vimacs:META-A| command is exactly the same as Vim's Command
mode |(| command.  Thus, many of the Vimacs commands were very simple to
imlpement.

						*cursor-at-eol*

One of the bigger complications that arose in Vimacs is that the cursor
position is conceptually different between Vim's various modes.  In Insert
mode, Vim's cursor is treated as being _between_ two characters, not "on" a
character.

In Normal mode, the cursor is treated as being "on" a character, and not
between the characters.  (If you use gvim, you can see that the cursor is a
normal block shape in Command mode, but the shape changes to a thin vertical
line in Insert Mode.)  This means that switching from Insert mode to Normal
mode can cause problems if you're at the end of a line.  The cursor seems to
'jump back' a character, because the cursor is _after_ the last character in
Insert mode, and when you revert to Normal mode, the cursor cannot be past the
end of the line, so it goes to the last character on the line.  Going back to
Insert Mode from there therefore puts your cursor one character back from the
end of the line, rather than being at the end of the line.

You can use the |a| command instead of the |i| to solve this problem, but then
you lose precision at the beginning of the line, rather than at the end.  It's
not a particularly easy problem to solve; I hope that Bram Moolenar provides
an option to change this behaviour in the future.

						*remapping-CTRL_O*

In Emacs, the <C-o> key is mapped to `open-line'; in Vim, <C-o> executes one
command in Normal mode, and then returns to Insert mode (see |i_CTRL-O|).
This poses a problem: internally, Vim uses <C-o> for many commands, and
remapping it to `open-line' causes problems.  Commands such as |:amenu| use
<C-o> to return to Normal mode from Insert mode, and thus remapping <C-o> can
lead to interesting problems.

There will be an option in the future to prevent <C-o> from being remapped at
all; of course, this means that you can't remap the <C-o> to a function at
all, which isn't ideal.

The `proper' way to fix this would be for Vim to limit the <C-o> mapping to
Insert mode only, and fix the other commands (such as |:amenu|) so that they
always use the unmapped version of <C-o>.

						*vimacs-quotes*

Conrad Parker: "Dude, I gotta get you doing some serious hacking
projects"

Erik de Castro Lopo: "Oh, so you're the insane guy that K was talking
about"

Wichert Akkerman: "Gross. Horror. Vim abuse. Mind if I include this as
an example in the Debian vim packages? :)"

(add yours here if you like :)


==============================================================================
*Vimacs.08*  Known Problems

						*vimacs-and-lazyredraw*

Vim seems to be a bit buggy and occasionally doesn't redraw the screen
properly when it should, if you have the 'lazyredraw' option set.  Please turn
it off if you notice redraw glitches.

This is a problem in Vim, not Vimacs, but Vimacs seems to exarcerbate the
problem.

						*vimacs-meta-d-at-eol*

Pressing <M-d> at the end of the line (EOL) doesn't delete the word.

						*vimacs-unix-esc-key*

On Unix console systems (i.e. not gvim), you may get a warning when you press
<Esc> twice telling you to use the <F1> or <C-z> keys to return to Normal
mode.  i.e. You can't do a simple <Esc> press to return to Normal mode, as you
normally do in Vi(m).  In a nutshell, this is because of Vim's 'insertmode'
option.

When 'insertmode' is turned on, Vim normally remaps the <Esc> key so that
novice users don't find themselves in Vim's Normal mode if they accidently hit
<Esc>.  Remember that 'insertmode' is originally designed for |evim|, which is
a point-and-click editor in the style of Windows Notepad.  You don't want
users winding up in Normal mode if they want something as simple as Notepad!

Due to the way that Unix terminals were originally designed, if:

	1. you are running Vimacs in a Unix console,
	2. have |g:VM_UseInsertMode| (and the 'insertmode' option) set
	3. have |g:VM_UnixConsoleRemapEsc| set
	4. have |g:VM_SingleEscToNormal| set

when Vim receives an <Esc> key, it is completely impossible to determine
whether it is part of a Meta key mapping (such as <M-f>) or the single <Esc>
key press that you did to get out of Insert mode.  The simple solution to this
is: either get used to the <F1> or <C-z> keys to get back to Insert mode, or
change one of the above g:VM_ settings.  There's no way around it, sorry; this
is a limitation in the way that Vim and Unix consoles were designed.

Another way to solve the problem is to always make the user press <Esc> twice
to get back to Normal mode.  Vim will interpret an <Esc><Esc> in an
unambigious way, and therefore you will never have this problem.  To do this,
turn off the |'g:VM_SingleEscToNormal'| option.  The obvious problem with this
solution is that you need to change your habits, so that you must press
<Esc><Esc> to return to Normal mode, rather than a simple <Esc>.

Deep Vim and Unix hackers may be interested to hear why this happens.  Vim can
normally tell whether the <Esc> key is part of a Meta key sequence (such as
<Esc>f), by using its multitude of |:timeout|-related options.  However, if
|:insertmode| is set (which it is if |g:VM_UseInsertMode| is set), Vim changes
the <Esc> key so that it no longer brings you out of Insert mode.  To get
around this, we remap the <Esc> ourselves so that it does bring you out of
Insert mode.  We can do this in an environment which has a completely
unambigious <Esc> key; i.e. an <Esc> is always an <Esc>.  However, in the Unix
console, since many (most?) terminals send a <M-x> combo as <Esc>x, we must
change Vim's terminal settings to interpret a <Esc>x as <M-x>.  However, now
there's no way for Vim to tell whether the first <Esc> is a single <Esc> by
itself, or part of a larger sequence like <Esc>x, because we have both the
<Esc> key remapped to <C-l> and the <Esc> key being part of a larger key
sequence.  This unfortunate design flaw is therefore a limitation of both Vim
(because it changes the normal behaviour of <Esc>) and the Unix console
(because whoever designed the original terminals decided to put the real <Esc>
key on the keyboard, which should never have happened).  Any suggestions to
fix this annoying situation would save me a lot of pain :).

==============================================================================
*Vimacs.09*  Revision History (ChangeLog)

						*vimacs-changelog*

						*vimacs-0.95*

Fixed up 'duplicate tag "vimacs" in file vimacs.txt' when running helptags;
merci dopey!

BTW, Vimacs is now available in Debian, thanks to dopey!  apt-get install
vimacs to annoy everybody else using vim on your computer

						*vimacs-0.94*

Searching the last searched text with <C-s><C-s> or <C-r><C-r> now works a bit
better (although I'm still not 100% satisfied with it)

Fixed <M-<> not working

<C-Ins> in Visual mode now copies to the clipboard (PRIMARY selection in X)

<S-Del> in Visual mode now cuts to the clipboard (PRIMARY selection in X)

Fixed "trailing characters" error message when doing <M-%> (:QueryReplace)

Fixed QueryReplaceRegexp

						*vimacs-0.93*

Made the thankyou (credits) list look a bit nicer :).

						*vimacs-0.92*

<M-n> and <M-p> now cycle through the QuickFix list rather than perform the
next/previous search

<M-d> at EOL now deletes the word at the start of the next line,
instead of the last character at the end of the current line

<M-BS> on command line now deletes the word before the cursor

<M-w> on command line copies the selection (to register)

<C-y> on command line pastes the selection

Indenting on <Tab> key moved to a tab-indent.vim

						*vimacs-0.91*

Moved vi check to be much earlier in the script

Rewrote <C-k>: it's (much) simpler now

Updated Unix installation notes

<C-Space> at EOL will now include the last character on the line

Use Vim's 'keymodel' option instead of own g:VM_VisualMode variable

Use Vim's 'selectmode' option instead of own g:VM_ShiftSel variable

						*vimacs-0.9*

Added Piet Delport to THANKS section
  
Wrote a function to initialise a variable to a default value, with Piet's help
  
Added Barrie Stott to THANKS section
  
Added navigation keys such as <M-f> to Operator Pending mode (actually done in
0.2, but I forgot to add it to the ChangeLog.  Oops.)
  
Automatically pop up list of buffers for <C-x>b
  
Added <S-PageUp>, <S-PageDown>, <S-Home>, <S-End> to select region (for
g:VM_ShiftSel)
  
Added commandline abbreviations for query_replace
  
Added <M-x> to normal mode (yeah, I kept hitting <M-x> instead of just typing
a colon (':'); sad, innit?
  
<C-M-s> is now remapped in Insert mode instead of Normal mode
  
<M-%> (query-replace) and <C-M-%> (query-replace-regexp) now escape /
characters, so the s/// doesn't get messed up
  
Remapped <Esc><Space> to <M-Space> (for UNIX terminals)

<M-q> (fill-paragraph) now leaves cursor at fill point, thanks to the
very useful Mark() function stolen from foo.vim by Benji Fisher.

Added <M-0> ... <M-9> bindings for quick escape into Normal mode

Added <M-`> (that's Meta and a backtick) to return to Normal mode

Added <F10> to pulldown the menus (in the GUI system), ala GNU Emacs

Added VM_Enabled variable to allow users to not load Vimacs

Properly fixed mapping of <Esc>x keys to <M-x> keys, using the :set
command rather than :map

Added <C-x>r when in Visual mode to switch to Visual Block mode; this is
meant to (poorly) emulate Emacs' rectangle support.  It'll almost
definitely be changed at a later date, because this isn't similar to how
Emacs works at all

Changed <Silent> mappings to <silent> (see :help <silent>; it doesn't
mention that it's case-sensitive!)

Made <C-s> and <C-r> search forward/backward from within a search prompt

Added Hari Krishna Dara & Arun Easi to THANKS section

Made <C-Space> be more Emacs-like by making Vim go into Select mode rather
than Visual mode.  (This is now the default; set g:VM_VisualMode to 1 to
change it back to the old behaviour where <C-Space> triggers Visual mode.)

Added g:VM_SearchRepeatHighlight option, which highlights the current item
you're searching for if you press <C-s> or <C-r> to search again
 
Default for g:VM_AlwaysRemapEsc changed from 0 to 1, to maintain interface
consistency throughout all of vim's console/GUI versions

Initial formal documentation (vimacs.txt: check it out!)

Fixed <C-x><C-o> to leave one line

Added <C-x><C-q> (toggle-readonly)

Added <C-x><C-r> (find-file-read-only)

Added <C-x><C-u> (upcase-region)

<C-z> in Insert mode now jumps back to Command mode; to suspend Vimacs
from Insert mode, press <C-z> twice.  Note that you'll be in Normal mode
when you resume 

Fixed <M-Space> highlighting one less character than the current word

Changed all functions to have be internal to the script (i.e. use <SID>
mappings)

Implemented primitive yank-pop (<M-y>) support, but hey, it does work ...

Added Charles E. Campbell to THANKS section

<C-l> now actually redraws as well as recentering cursor

<C-Up> and <C-Down> move by paragraphs

<C-M-v> scrolls other window down.

Integration with Jeff Lanzarotta's BufExplorer plugin for <C-x>b.  Vimacs will
launch BufExplorer when you press <C-x>b if you have it.  BufExplorer will use
a default sort order of MRU, since this how it works in Emacs.  You will need
BufExplorer 6.0.16 for this to work properly, otherwise ':insertmode' will
screw things up ...

Added <C-M-/>, <C-M-x> and <C-]>: All map to Vim's |insert_expand| command

Added <C-k> to |Cmdline-mode|

<C-^> inserts the character above the cursor (|i_CTRL-Y|)


==============================================================================
*Vimacs.10*  In the Future ... (TODO list)

						*vimacs-todo*

Replace "set <M-x>=^[x" with a loop; ASCII range 7 to 127

Implement haskell-mode and <C-c><C-l> with vimsh for Manuel :)

BufExplorer used for bdelete etc. commands?

Don't overwrite maps.  Err.  Will be hard ...

GotoLine should accept a range or argument

Autoconfiscate ... is that overkill?!

Make <C-x>b silent (for :BufExplorer?)

C-x n p

Emacs-like status line?

"Mark stack" ala <C-Space> in Emacs, and <C-u><C-Space> to jump to last
marks

Add Mac notes to documentation.

Jed keys: <C-j> = newline but no indent, <C-x><C-l> = ?, <C-x><C-o> =
leave one line, <C-x><C-v> = find-alternate-file,

Emacs folding keys

Fix <C-M-s> and <C-s> to turn on regexps

Bind <S-Del>, <C-Ins> and <S-Ins>?

Follow mode (http://www.csd.uu.se/~andersl/follow.shtml).  Maybe as a
separate script; e.g. vimacs-follow.vim

Argument (M-1/M-2/etc) and universal argument keys.  Ahahaha, good
luck to me ... (hmm, v:count1 looks promising!)

mapcheck() everything -- oooh boy

Port the rest of XEmacs' 419830213 bindings

Zippy, Doctor, kitchen sink

						*vimacs-suggestions*

Please, please ask for key mappings which you consider to be fundamental
in Emacs!  This is a serious project, it's not another Vigor :).  I'm not
a veteran Emacs user by any means, so there are potentially scores of
keys which many consider to be fundamental which I am missing.  Send me
a request (or even better, a patch!) if you feel like a favourite key
binding is missing, or if behaviour is incorrect.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.
